In my PhD research, I investigated the adaptability of bilingual language control using both behavioral and EEG experiments. Moving forward, I plan to expand my research in two key directions:<br> 
1. Examining how the adaptive control system functions in ecologically valid, naturalistic settings.<br> 
2. Exploring how bilingual and bidialectal experiences dynamically influence domain-general cognitive control.<br> 

By advancing knowledge in how people learn and use languages, I seek to contribute to the development of more efficient and effective language learning and using strategies, as well as language-based cognitive interventions, particularly for addressing cognitive aging.
