## About
I earned my PhD in Psychology (2024) from [Beijing Normal University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing_Normal_University), specializing in psycholinguistics. Before that, I completed my MA in Teaching Chinese to Speakers of Other Languages (2020) at [Peking University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peking_University), focusing on the processing of constructions among L2 Chinese learners. I also hold a BA from [Beijing Foreign Studies University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing_Foreign_Studies_University) (2016), where I double-majored in Teaching Chinese as Foreign Language and English Language and Literature.

## Research interests
**Broad:** Psycholinguistics, Neurolinguistics, Bilingualism and Cognition, Second Language Acquisition<br /><br /> 
**Narrow:** Bilingual Language Control<br />
A bilingualâ€™s two languages may always be active, even when only one is required. This process might be expected to produce frequent unintended cross-language intrusions, but these errors are rare in spontaneous speech and the laboratory. Bilinguals must, therefore, benefit from a control mechanism that allows them to select which language to use at a given moment and in a given context. This language control mechanism is my main research focus.<br /><br /> 
My ongoing work focuses on two topics:<br />
(1) Bilingual language control in emotional and social contexts (Jiang et al., [2024](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jml.2024.104527))<br />
(2) Interconnection between bilingual language control and cognitive control (Jiang et al., [2023](https://doi.org/10.1017/S1366728922000323), [2024](https://doi.org/10.1017/S1366728923000494))
